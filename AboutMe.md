# AboutMe

Hello, my name is James Struble. This is the About Me section for my personal site. I am a sophmore at University of Missouri - Mizzou pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. After graduating, I hope to land a career in *digital media production*, preferably making indie video games. Some of my hobbies are hanging out with friends, especially over a nice meal or a game of Dungeons and Dragons (even if I'm forced to be DM), singing (I was in my high school's chamber choir and I am currently in Mizzou Forte, collecting decorative Halloween houses, and doodling!
